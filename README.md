# Crop-Recommendation

This project aims to predict the most suitable crops to be grown based on soil features (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) and weather features
(Temperature, Humidity, pH, Rainfall).

1. Data Analysis : Gaining some insights from the data available in the dataset
2. Model Training : Training various models and choosing the best one to predict.

Future Enhancements
● Adding geographical data for better recommendations.

● Collaborating with government to add soil analysis appointment feature.

● Dynamic soil and weather analysis by installing devices.

● Collaboration with agriculture university to get survey data.

● Adding market demand analysis in order for the ease to choose from multiple recommended crops.

● Adding category of crops in order to filter the recommendation.
